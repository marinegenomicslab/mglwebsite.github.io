abstract: Abstract  Patterns of genetic variation reflect interactions among microevolutionary
  forces that vary in strength with changing demography. Here, patterns of variation
  within and among samples of the mouthbrooding gafftopsail catfish ( Bagre marinus
  , Family Ariidae) captured in the U.S. Atlantic and throughout the Gulf of Mexico
  were analyzed using genomics to generate neutral and non‐neutral SNP data sets.
  Because genomic resources are lacking for ariids, linkage disequilibrium network
  analysis was used to examine patterns of putatively adaptive variation. Finally,
  historical demographic parameters were estimated from site frequency spectra. The
  results show four differentiated groups, corresponding to the (1) U.S. Atlantic,
  and the (2) northeastern, (3) northwestern, and (4) southern Gulf of Mexico. The
  non‐neutral data presented two contrasting signals of structure, one due to increases
  in diversity moving west to east and north to south, and another to increased heterozygosity
  in the Atlantic. Demographic analysis suggested that recently reduced long‐term
  effective population size in the Atlantic is likely an important driver of patterns
  of genetic variation and is consistent with a known reduction in population size
  potentially due to an epizootic. Overall, patterns of genetic variation resemble
  that of other fishes that use the same estuarine habitats as nurseries, regardless
  of the presence/absence of a larval phase, supporting the idea that adult/juvenile
  behavior and habitat are important predictors of contemporary patterns of genetic
  structure.  ,  Gafftopsail catfish show high levels of genetic structuring across
  their distribution in the U.S., Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Non‐neutral data present
  two contrasting signals of structure and historical demography is likely an important
  driver of patterns of neutral and non‐neutral genetic variation. Results of this
  study are similar to what is seen in other fishes that use the same estuarine habitats
  as nurseries, but gafftopsail catfish lack a larval phase, supporting the idea that
  adult/juvenile behavior and habitat use are important predictors of contemporary
  patterns of genetic structure.
