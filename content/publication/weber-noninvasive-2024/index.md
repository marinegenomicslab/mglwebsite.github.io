abstract: 'Age data are essential for estimating life history parameters and are thus
  critical for population assessment, management, and conservation. Traditional vertebrae-based
  age estimation in elasmobranchs can be costly, time intensive, of low accuracy,
  and is by necessity lethal. Herein, epigenetic clocks were developed for an elasmobranch,
  the cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus), using aquarium-born individuals (n = 42) with
  known dates of birth (age range: 7−7,878 days or 0−21 years) and two tissue types
  (fin clips and whole blood) that can be sampled in a relatively non-invasive manner.
  Enzymatically-converted restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ECrad-seq) was
  used to identify CpG sites that exhibited age-correlated DNA methylation. The epigenetic
  clocks developed were highly accurate (mean absolute error, MAE, < 0.75 years) and
  precise (R2 > 0.98). Age-associated CpG sites were identified across tissues, and
  a multi-tissue clock was also highly accurate (MAE < 1 year) and precise (R2 = 0.97).
  Using the developed fin clip clock, three wild-caught individuals of unknown age
  but managed in aquariums for > 22 years were predicted to be 22.10−23.49 years old.
  Overall, the results have important implications for future epigenetic clock development
  and noninvasive age estimation in elasmobranchs.'
